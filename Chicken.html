            <p>From an early age, I was taught to be strong and fearless. I was a black rooster with sharp claws and an iron character. I have always strived to win, sparing no one. One day he met his fiercest rival, another black cock. The fight began, we were flapping our wings and pecking at each other with great fury. But in the end I was stronger. A deafening shout of victory echoed through the surroundings. I was a winner and a well-deserved leader of my pack. And no one will dare to stand in my way.
        
            </p>    
        </div>
        <div class="old">
            <p>But now I'm more mature. Winning a fight with another rooster taught me not only to be stronger, but also to realize that real strength lies in wisdom and self-control. I no longer seek conflicts and do not aim for unconditional victory, sparing no one's feelings. I have learned that true leadership lies not just in strength, but also in respecting others and making compromises. Now, I have become a balanced leader who knows how to listen and support my team. My former cruelty has been replaced by wise management, and my team is thriving under my guidance. I have grown not only stronger but also more wise.
